title: Using MTA Turnstile Data to Create a Smart Canvasseering Plan
---

I ride the subway everyday, along with millions of others. Each time someone swipes their card and plows 
through the turnstile, the MTA captures that bit of data at that points in time (well, actually during that
specific four hour increment, to be precise). 

For our first project at Metis, we were challenged with the task of downloading, cleaning, organizing, 
scrubbing, and analyzing this data to help a fake organization with the task of deploying a street team
to canvas for a gala. The task was loosely defined: we knew that the gala appealed to women in tech and
that is about it. The rest was up to us to determine.

Thus, my team and I started out by creating our own assumptions for the gala. 

I will finish my blog post this weekend with details on the data side of things.
